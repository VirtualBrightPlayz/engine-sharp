# About

This is a simple game framework/engine. Don't expect much out of it.

In order for audio to work, you will need [soft_oal.dll from OpenAL Soft (version 1.23.1) in the bin folder](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/releases/tag/1.23.1).

In order for GUI to work, you will need [cimgui.dll from the ImGui.NET (version 1.91.6.1) NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ImGui.NET/1.91.6.1). You can extract the dll using 7zip or [The NuGet package explorer in the runtimes folder](https://nuget.info/packages/ImGui.NET/1.91.6.1).

## SCP-087-B

`/GameBSrc` is a source translation of [SCP-087-B](https://www.scpcbgame.com/scp-087-b.html).
Although it worked at one point, it probably does not compile with the updated engine code. A desktop version can be found [here](https://virtualwebsite.net/files/087B_REMAKE.zip) and web version [here](https://virtualwebsite.net/087b/).

## SCP - Containment Breach

`/GameSrc` is a partial source translation of [SCP - Containment Breach](https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb).
There isn't any compiled binary downloads at this time.

## Propnado 2

`/Propnado2` is a project I stopped working on a while ago, and is an (unfinished and early stages) copy of my Garry's Mod gamemode found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2306824359).
